Deploy proof of concept environment to test Azure Accelerated Networking

Currently it is a Preview feature, and you must register for the preview https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/virtual-network-accelerated-networking-powershell/

Make sure to delete the test environment after you have finished since D15v2 VMs that are currently the only SKU available will end up being costly if left running.
